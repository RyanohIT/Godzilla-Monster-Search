My goal for this Project was to create 4 separate pages with each one fulfulling a requirment, some pages maybe more than one. On the initial load page the login information is Monarch for the username and Godzilla for the Password. It should not allow you to enter anything else. I had hoped to implement a Search feature that allowed you to search for various Godzilla monsters as the entire premise of the website is a Monarch site built to inform its employees of the dangerous monsters roaming the earth. On the Doomsday Countdown page, I have a countdown timer and a calendar imbued with GoogleMaps endpoints so that when the countdown timer ends it takes you to a movie theater in Japan. The same movie theater is encounterable by clicking on the highlighted day in the Calendar and clicking on the address or the Doomsday Epicenter button on the bottom left that comes up when the Calendar flips. My endeavor faltered due to not being able to absorb and implement the requisite Javascript in enough time to comprehend the proper way to dictate API data, I do have sound autoplaying so that it sounds like Godzilla is near at the start of every page that you need to click the pause button on as it loops. My goal was to utilize Node.js and Bootstrap to assist with the project parameters. I had to rewatch the videos a few times and even now I barely comprehend them, so I definitely need to continue learning.
